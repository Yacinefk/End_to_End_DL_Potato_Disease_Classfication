# End_to_End_DL_Potato_Disease_Classfication
This APP has been built by ATLIQ Agriculture AI Company
- I worked on this awesome deep learning project with  MR Dhaval Patel it's very usefull app in agriculture
- Starting from:
     1. Data Collection
     2. Model Building 
     3. ML Ops using TF Serving to build backend serving using FastAPI
     4. Model Deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Basically the Project starts from:
     1. collecting large amount of images 
     2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing is the next step using 
            * TENSORFLOW Dataset
            * Data Augmentation to create more training samples by applying techniques like (Flipping, contrast, Rotation ...)
     3. Than Model Building using CNN   
     4. Evaluate the model 
     5. Plot the lost and Accuracy of our model
     6. than we exported our trained model
     7. Than we used FastAPI
     8. Than we built a Website with ReactJS. which helped us by dragging the images into it and we get our predictions
